== Description ==

The Old Post Promoter (OPP) is a Wordpress plugin by the Blog Traffic Exchange.  The purpose of the plugin is to promote old posts by sending them back onto the front page and into the RSS feed. It does it randomly choosing an eligible post and updating the publication timestamp.  The post then appears to be the latest post on your Wordpress blog.  "You down with OPP? Yeah you know me!"

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Isn't that duplicate content?  =

No. The original post has the publication timestamp changed.  There remains only only copy of the post.

= If you change the timestamp won't that affect my pretty permalinks which include dates?  =

Yes it will.  Did you read the warning? This plugin should no be used with permalink structures that include dates. This is yet another reason why you should not use such a structure.  

= Your plugin is so cool. I want to get rid of dates from my permalink structure, how do I do it?  =
